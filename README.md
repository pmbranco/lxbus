# LX Bus #

LX Bus is an application to inform people how much time they have to
wait for a bus in the Lisbon Public Bus Transportation System
(Carris).

Carris uses a cumbersome e-mail system to inform users about the
estimated bus waiting time, so I wrapped this system in a web app with
nice desktop and handheld interfaces. 


# Public Working Instance #

I have a working instance working at Google ap engine
(<http://lxbusinfo.appspot.com>). You can try it there using your
browser in a mobile or desktop device.

The public API is also accessible at that address.


# Public API #

You can build your own application to check waiting times for a Lisbon
bus. All you have to do is query the public API at
<http://lxbusinfo.appspot.com>. You can check my blog post at
<http://simaomata.com/blog/?p=127> to know how to do that. You can
also contact me, I'll be glad to help.
